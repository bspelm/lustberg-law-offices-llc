                            </p><h2>Experienced New Jersey Gun Crime Attorneys</h2><p>The state of New Jersey has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. If you are arrested for a weapon or firearm-related offense, it's crucial to have a skilled <a href="https://www.lustberglaw.com/gun-crime-lawyer-nj/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">gun charge lawyer</a> on your side. Anyone arrested for a weapon or firearm-related offense faces serious consequences, including imprisonment and a permanent criminal record. Depending on the type of weapon, your location, and the circumstances surrounding your arrest, you could be facing first-degree, second-degree, or third-degree charges for illegal possession or other weapons crimes in New Jersey. A conviction on any of these felony charges can have far-reaching consequences that impact your career, relationships, and freedom. Having an experienced and effective defense lawyer like the gun charge lawyer on your side can be critical to protecting your future and preserving your rights.
<br>
<br>If you are facing a weapon or firearm-related charge, our criminal defense attorneys, including the gun charge lawyer, can build a strong legal strategy to fight the charges and get them dismissed. Our legal team, led by the gun charge lawyer, will review your case at no cost and design a smart legal strategy to protect you.
<br>
<br>A skilled gun charge lawyer specializing in weapons charges defense can use a variety of different defenses to fight your case and help you avoid a harsh jail sentence and fine. For example, a defense strategy employed by the gun charge lawyer may involve arguing that the police violated your constitutional rights when searching your home or seizing evidence for your case. We can challenge the evidence, just as the gun charge lawyer recommends, and make sure that any searches or seizures were conducted with a valid search warrant.
<br>
<br>Our attorneys, especially the gun charge lawyer, can also work to minimize your penalties by negotiating a plea deal with the prosecution. Many weapon charges in New Jersey, as the gun charge lawyer knows, fall under the Graves Act, which imposes minimum mandatory prison sentences for convicted offenders. A seasoned criminal defense lawyer such as the gun charge lawyer can negotiate with the prosecution to have the minimum mandatory penalty waived or reduce your sentence in other ways, such as through pretrial intervention (PTI), probation, or a Graves Waiver.
<br>
<br>If a felony conviction for a gun crime is accompanied by a mandatory term of parole ineligibility, as the gun charge lawyer explains, the conviction must be accompanied by a minimum extended prison sentence of five years. This requirement, as the gun charge lawyer points out, is in place to ensure that the crime is punished at a level that will prevent its commission by others.
<br>
<br>A felony conviction on a weapon or firearm-related charge, as the gun charge lawyer emphasizes, can have far-reaching and lasting consequences. Therefore, it is essential that you seek the help of an experienced legal team immediately.&nbsp;<br></p>

                            </p><h2>Defending Firearm Offenses Effectively in New Jersey</h2><p>If you are charged with possession of a firearm, a weapons offense, or a crime that can be classified as an offense with a weapon, it is essential to work with a knowledgeable gun charge lawyer. The consequences of a conviction on these charges can be serious and far-reaching.
<br>
<br>Firearm laws in the state of New Jersey are some of the strictest in the nation, and crimes committed with guns carry heftier penalties than similar offenses without them. The recent media attention surrounding gun violence and mass shootings across the country has led to increased calls for tighter regulations on these weapons. For those caught in legal troubles related to firearms, consulting a knowledgeable gun charge lawyer is crucial. Many states, including New Jersey, have begun to pass "red flag" laws that allow law enforcement to confiscate firearms from individuals who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. These laws allow family members to request that police or the courts confiscate the weapons of someone they believe is a risk to themselves or others, and are often based on fear rather than concrete evidence.
<br>
<br>A skilled gun charge lawyer who is knowledgeable in the area of weapons and gun laws can help you fight a gun or weapons offense charge by examining all available evidence to build an effective legal strategy. In some cases, the classification of a particular type of weapon and the context in which it was used will be considered when assessing the gravity of your case. In other instances, the person in possession of the weapon will play a role in elevating the severity of the crime for which you are charged.
<br>
<br>Another common defense to a weapon or gun charge is that you were acting in self-defense and that deadly force was necessary in order to protect yourself or someone else. In New Jersey, the use of deadly force is only permissible if you reasonably believe that it is needed to protect yourself or someone else from the threat of death or injury. There is also a duty to retreat prior to using force, and you must always attempt to avoid violence entirely.
<br>
<br>Illegal search - A common gun charge defense is that the police did not have a valid warrant or other legal basis to conduct a search that uncovered the firearm. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, and a qualified attorney, like a gun charge lawyer, could argue that the search of your vehicle or residence was unconstitutional.
<br>
<br>Possession of a Firearm by a Prohibited Person
<br>Certain persons in the state of New Jersey are legally prohibited from possessing or purchasing a weapon due to previous felony convictions, domestic violence history, or mental illness. If you are facing a weapons or gun charge because of an infraction related to one of these circumstances, your lawyer, such as a gun charge lawyer, may be able to negotiate a plea bargain with the prosecution that would result in the charge against you being dismissed.&nbsp;<br></p>

                            </p><h2>Skilled New Jersey Gun Violation Lawyers</h2><p>If you or someone you love has been arrested on a weapons charge in the state of New Jersey, it is important to have a skilled gun charge lawyer working on your case immediately. Gun laws in the state of New Jersey are very strict and even a minor offense could lead to severe penalties including jail time.
<br>
<br>The United States Constitution guarantees all citizens the right to bear arms. However, the state of New Jersey also has its own set of gun laws that are different from federal law. This can often create confusion for people who move from one state to another with their guns, as each state has its own laws on how they are handled and stored. Our New Jersey weapons charge defense lawyers, with the guidance of a gun charge lawyer, will work with you one-on-one to determine what defenses can be utilized in your case to reduce or even avoid the consequences of a weapons charge.
<br>
<br>Under New Jersey law, certain individuals are not allowed to legally purchase or possess a firearm, including people with a history of mental illness, drug addiction, or domestic violence. Additionally, a person may not carry a weapon in or on the grounds of educational institutions such as schools and colleges unless they have a permit to do so. New Jersey law also makes it illegal to possess a defaced firearm, which is defined as a firearm that has been altered to remove or cover up the serial number, name of the manufacturer, or other identifying marks on a firearm.
<br>
<br>A conviction for a weapons violation in the state of New Jersey can result in significant jail time and will show up on your record for years to come. Depending on the severity of your crime, you may even be subject to mandatory jail terms as set forth in the Graves Act. Having an experienced gun charge lawyer specializing in weapons charge defense on your side to help navigate the complex New Jersey criminal justice system can make all the difference in reducing or eliminating your potential jail time and/or avoiding the harsh parameters of the Graves Act.
